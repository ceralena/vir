Vir is a simple cross-platform music library management tool.

## What it Does

* help organise music into correctly structured directories
* flag incomplete or inconsistent idv2/3 tags
* identify duplicates

The `vir` command has various sub-commands for operating on your music library.

Vir is written in [go](http://golang.org/), for performance and portability reasons.
